## GitHub Dependents scraping tool

Do you have an open source competitor and their tool is `used by` hundereds or thousands of people? 

Scraping the data will allow you to have the ability to reach out to them for cold outreach. 

Set the number of `MAX_DEPENDENTS` and run the script `node index.js`. 

After a few seconds to a couple of minutes a `.csv` file will be created that you can upload to a spreadsheet.
